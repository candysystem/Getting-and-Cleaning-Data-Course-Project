<b>Description of abbreviations of measurements</b>


<b>Leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.</b>

Body = related to body movement.

Gravity = acceleration of gravity

Acc = accelerometer measurement

Gyro = gyroscopic measurements

Jerk = sudden movement acceleration

Mag = magnitude of movement


Mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.
The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.



<b>Signals used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:</b>

‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.
